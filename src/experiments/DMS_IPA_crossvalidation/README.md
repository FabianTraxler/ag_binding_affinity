Here, we test how DMS dataset training helps prediction/validation on other DMS datasets

First test relative_L2 alone

We test first all DMS combinations on a single configuration (L2 absolute loss)



Then we test a single combination with an extensive configuration
- what about the output layers???
- relative_L2+L2, relative_cdf, ..
