DMS single prediction sweep
====================================

See also https://github.com/moritzschaefer/guided-protein-diffusion/issues/299 for more details.

The base arguments are defined in 'base_args.txt'.

I used plateau scheduling as the default as it is strictly at least as good as constant. The wandb_user argument needs to be changed as it is currently set to my own wandb account.
