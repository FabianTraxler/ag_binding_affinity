The base arguments are defined in 'base_args.txt', I used plateau scheduling as the default as it is strictly at least as good as constant. The wandb_user argument needs to be changed as it is currently set to my own wandb account.
The number of sweep runs is currently set to 72, as this is the number necessary to search over all grid parameters once.

The parameters beings seached over in sweep_config.yaml are:

 target_dataset:
    - "DMS-madan21_mutat_hiv:absolute"
    - "DMS-phillips21_bindin:absolute"
    - "DMS-taft22_deep_mutat_learn_predic_ace2:absolute"
    - "DMS-starr21_prosp_covid:absolute"

loss_function:
    - "L1"
    - "L2"
    - "L1+L2"

aggregation_method:
    - "interface_sum"
    - "mean"

seed:
    - 1
    - 2
    - 3

If any of these are changed, make sure to adjust the sweep_runs parameter if you want to ensure that each parameter combination is tested at least once.
